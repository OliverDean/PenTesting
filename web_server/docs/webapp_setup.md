How to Set Up the Python Virtual Environment and Run the Server
    
    Open a terminal or command prompt:
        On Windows, you can search for "Command Prompt" or use PowerShell.
        On Mac/Linux, open the terminal from your applications or press Ctrl + Alt + T on your keyboard.

    Navigate to the project folder:
        Use the cd (change directory) command to navigate to the folder where all your project files are located. For example:

            cd path/to/your/project

Create a Python Virtual Environment:

    A virtual environment isolates your project’s dependencies, so they don’t interfere with other projects or system-wide Python installations. In the project folder, run the following command:

        python -m venv venv

    This will create a new virtual environment called venv inside your project directory.

Activate the Virtual Environment:

    To activate the virtual environment:
        On Windows, type:

            .\venv\Scripts\activate

        On Mac/Linux, type:

            source venv/bin/activate

After activation, your terminal prompt will change to show (venv) in front of the command line, indicating the virtual environment is active.

Install the Required Packages:

    Now that the virtual environment is active, you need to install the necessary dependencies for the project. These are listed in the requirements.txt file. To install them, run:

        pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Server:

    To start the server, use the following command:

        python ./server.py

    This will start the server and keep it running. You can now access your application via a web browser.

Access the Website:

    The website can be found at http://localhost:8080.

That's it! You should now have the server running and the website displayed in the browser.
