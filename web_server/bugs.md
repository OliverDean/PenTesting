Known Bugs:

there is issues with maintaining the jwt token for searching and loading items 

admin routes on front end not working

empty db


Todo:

not all of the routes in the server are reflected in the js or html

the html isn't secure

there are no intentional vulns

the db is probably too complex

it needs a root level privilege 

the admin stuff isn't integrated properly
